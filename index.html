        <p>
            Laguna Brava Ecotourism is an organization run by <em>local community</em> members based in Laguna Brava.
            Laguna
            Brava is
            a karstic lake of incomparable beauty located in western Guatemala. <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karst"">Laguna Brava</a> is located in a remote and
        highly underdeveloped region, so reaching and exploring the lake takes a mix of extreme adventure and intimate
        contact with nature. The lake beauty lies in the colours variety of its waters, which depends on the sun's
        position. Laguna Brava is also known as Yolnabaj by the region's inhabitants, which translates as " rough
                lake". Despite its name, the waters of Laguna Brava Laguna are so calm that they instantly awaken a deep
                feeling of peace. </p>
